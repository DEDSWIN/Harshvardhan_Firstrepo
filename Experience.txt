Hi there, Im Harshvardhan from Moradabad, U.P.
My throughout experience of college is mixed. There are some things which i liked more as- campus, infrastructure, mess food.
On the contrary there are some lack of facilities in new boys hostel( but i understand it'll be provided soon).
Academics are good, but we have to revise the topics by ourselves too to get the grasp of concepts.
Loved the Gymkhana and clubs, pronite was awsm.
Still exploring.
